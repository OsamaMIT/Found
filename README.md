## About
A web app ***prototype*** for a platform that facilitates finding others that you know nearby, whether it's between classes or when visiting a mall.

It is currently still in development.

## Stack
The entire web app is created with Python, so Streamlit was used for the 'frontend' and hosting, while MongoDB was used for the database. 

## Inspiration
Inspired by all the times I found students looking for someone free or around in my first month of university.
